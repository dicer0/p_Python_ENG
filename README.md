## Thomson Reuters Assignment
Please modify the file (or add your own files and organize them in any way you like) such that:
- The API provides a barebones Chat service that a front-end client can use.
- The service should have the following capabilities:
    - an HTTP client can create a new chat session
    - given a chat session (e.g. its ID), an HTTP client can send a message on behalf of the user, and receive the "AI" response from the LLM.
    - responses from the AI should be streamed using the SSE mechanism mentioned above.
    - an HTTP client can also fetch the entire message history for a given session

You'll likely need some sort of persistence. It's 100% acceptable to store chat messages in memory, but if you want to show off, feel free to use any of SQLite, Postgres, Redis, or just flat files for persistence. If you do this, make sure the rest of the functional requirements are met.
Do not worry about things like user authentication or really any other production consideration not already mentioned above.
